            The University of Manitoba campuses are located on original<br>lands of Anishinaabeg, Cree, Oji-Cree, Dakota and 
            Dene peoples,<br>and on the homeland of the MÃ©tis Nation. We respect the<br>Treaties that were made on these territories, 
            we acknowledge<br>the harms and mistakes of the past, and we dedicate<br>ourselves to move forward in partnership 
            with Indigenous<br>communities in a spirit of reconciliation and collaboration.</h3>
